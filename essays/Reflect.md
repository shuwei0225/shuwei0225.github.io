*TypeScript: a superset of JavaScript that adds optional static typing.*

## First Steps with TypeScript

When I first started using TypeScript, it felt both familiar and strange. Since I already had some experience with Java and C++, I understood the benefits of types—they make code easier to follow and help catch mistakes early. But JavaScript has always been about flexibility, and I was worried that adding strict typing would take away the freedom that makes it so popular. After going through the module, I realized TypeScript doesn’t restrict creativity—it just adds tools that let me be clearer and more intentional. Using things like interface and readonly made me think more carefully about the structure of my code. To me, it feels like JavaScript growing into something more serious and suited for bigger, long-term projects.

## Facing the WODs

The WODs brought a completely different challenge. At first, I found them stressful. Having a timer running while coding made me nervous, and I blanked on things I normally knew. My first few attempts felt rough. But with practice, I started to see why we do them. They reminded me of sports drills—you repeat something over and over, under pressure, until it becomes second nature. Eventually, I noticed I was coding faster, looking up syntax less often, and staying calmer when the timer was ticking. The stress is still there, but the improvement is real.

## Learning Under Pressure

This way of learning is not always enjoyable in the moment, but it pays off afterward. Instead of passively reading or watching tutorials, the WODs force me to practice in a way that sticks. I know myself—I need that kind of pressure to really grow. Without it, I’d probably coast and not push myself. It’s uncomfortable, but it’s the kind of uncomfortable that makes you better.

## Looking Ahead

After this module, I can see how both TypeScript and athletic software engineering fit together. TypeScript adds structure without killing the freedom of JavaScript, and the WODs build confidence through repetition and practice. Together, they make me see software engineering less as just solving problems and more as a craft—something that requires tools, discipline, and consistent effort. It’s not always easy, but that’s what makes it worth doing.
