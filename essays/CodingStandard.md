# Coding Standards: More Than Just Style Rules

When I first heard “coding standards,” I thought it just meant stuff like two spaces vs. four spaces, or where to put curly braces. Honestly, that part doesn’t really matter to me. But after a little more experience, I started to see that coding standards aren’t just about style—they actually shape how you think about writing code and working with others.

## Why Standards Help

I’ve gone back to my own old code before and had no idea what I was doing. That’s a terrible feeling. Standards help with that because they make code consistent and easier to understand. They also catch bad habits early. For example, a rule that complains about an unused variable isn’t just being picky—it’s telling me that I wrote something unnecessary or forgot to clean up my code.

So in that sense, standards aren’t really about being “strict.” They’re about making your future self (and your teammates) thankful that you wrote something clean and understandable.

## My First Week With ESLint

When I started using ESLint in VSCode, it honestly felt painful at first. My code was full of squiggly red lines. I felt like I couldn’t type two lines without ESLint yelling at me. But once I got used to it, I realized those warnings were actually making me better. ESLint wasn’t stopping me from coding—it was teaching me to code in a more professional way.

Now, I actually like fixing the errors. It feels like a checklist that makes my code cleaner and safer. The small annoyances upfront save me way more time later.

## Learning by Doing

The best part is how coding standards help me *learn* a language. When you’re new to JavaScript or TypeScript, you don’t always know the “best” way to do something. ESLint shows you. After a while, you don’t even think about the rule—you just write it correctly by habit. It’s kind of like learning grammar in English: the rules feel forced at first, but then it just becomes natural.

## Wrapping It Up

If I had to pick only one technique to improve code quality, I’d choose coding standards. They help me avoid mistakes, they make teamwork easier, and they even speed up the learning process. The short-term pain is worth it. At the end of the day, coding standards aren’t about style fights over braces—they’re about writing code that’s easier for everyone to understand, including yourself.
