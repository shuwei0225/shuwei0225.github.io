In the context of engineering

Why does this matter beyond coding interviews? Because building efficient systems is an engineering mindset. Choosing the right solution depends on context: sometimes space is limited, sometimes speed is critical.
The “Is Unique” project is a small but clear example of how engineers must think: not just can I solve it, but how should I solve it best for my constraints?

In the context of learning

This project also reflects a bigger truth: simple problems are not always easy problems. Implementing made me slow down and think about the fundamentals of data structures, complexity, and design choices.isUnique
That’s why I find value in this kind of exercise. Even if the code is short, the lessons last much longer.

Conclusion

The “Is Unique” project may be a small program, but it captures the essence of problem solving in computer science. It reminds me that every solution has trade-offs, and that practice with these building blocks prepares me for tackling larger, more complex challenges ahead.
