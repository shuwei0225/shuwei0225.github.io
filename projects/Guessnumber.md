This project implements a simple “Guess the Number” game played in the console. The computer selects a random number within a certain range, and the player must guess the number. After each guess, the program provides feedback indicating whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct.  

I used Java to generate random numbers, read user input, and loop until the correct number was guessed. The game also keeps track of the number of attempts and displays the result when the player wins.
